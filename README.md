MarbleMadness
=============

Marble Madness clone - old student project (2nd year at the university).

Game written in Java. For rendering JOGL is used (Java bindings for OpenGL). Requires native libraries in order to work.

Everything included here was created from scratch. I did not read any professional books on game/engine development. Graphics engine and physics engine do work but the code looks awful. At the time I had almost no experience in writing software. 

The game has only one level just to demonstrate that it works.
